# Java-Tic-Tac-Toe

A very simple text-based, 2-player tictactoe game in Java running in an IDE console environment.

The tic-tac-toe game is played on a 3 × 3 grid. The game is played by two players, who take turns. The first player marks moves with a 'X', the second with a 'O'. The player who has formed a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal sequence of three marks wins. This program draws the game board, asks the user for the coordinates (row#, col#) of the next mark, changes the players after every successful move, and pronounces the winner.
